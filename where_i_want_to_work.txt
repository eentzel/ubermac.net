- I believe that the optimal size of the firm is getting smaller
- I prefer small, profitable (ideally bootstrapped) companies
- I prefer an open-source like culture:
     - written comms: email, wiki, etc.
     - code reivew via pull request
     - ownership model (*not* "stay out of my area", but stewardship)
- I believe most programmers (certainly me) do their best work in an
  environment conducive to concentration - this means reasonably quiet, but
  more importantly, a high threshold for interruptions. Private offices work
  great. Shared workspace with a small (say max 4 person) team working with a
  similar focus & rhythym is great as well. Open plan is *very* hard to
  prevent degenerating into an interrupt-driven culture.
- Remote obviously is conducive to concentration as well, but requires
  dedication to a remote model.
