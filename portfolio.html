        <h1>Eric Entzel's Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Here are some of the projects I've worked on:
            <dl>
                <dt><a href="http://www.ubermac.net/raidplanner/">Thunderclese's raid planner</a></dt>
                <dd>A web app to help plan World of Warcraft raid groups.</dd>

                <dt><a href="http://www.myeventbot.com/">EventBot</a></dt>
                <dd>A tool to create Google Calendar events via email.</dd>

                <dd>
                    Directory site for the largest Internet Yellow
                    Pages company in the Netherlands, with over 6.9
                    million monthly unique visitors. With colleagues
                    at <a href="http://www.localmatters.com/">Local
                    Matters</a>, I implemented cross-browser UI for
                    everything from basic pages to interactive
                    Javascript maps. I also worked closely with the
                    operations team to debug and resolve production
                    issues. Recently, I've taken the lead in
                    implementing performance improvements, including
                    request optimization
                    and <a href="http://www.varnish-cache.org/">Varnish</a>
                    caching, to greatly reduce hardware requirements
                    and speed up the site for end users.
