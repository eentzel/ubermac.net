        <h1>Eric Entzel's Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Here are some of the projects I've worked on:
            <dl>
                <dt><a href="http://www.ubermac.net/raidplanner/">Thunderclese's raid planner</a></dt>
                <dd>A web app to help plan World of Warcraft raid groups.</dd>

                <dt><a href="http://www.myeventbot.com/">EventBot</a></dt>
                <dd>
                    EventBot is a service I created that allows users
                    to create Google Calendar events by sending an
                    email to their own personal EventBot
                    address. Written in Python & deployed
                    on <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google
                    App Engine.</a> Despite only having ~10 unique
                    users per day, I've learned a lot about
                    scalability by using the loosely-coupled
                    architecture that App Engine encourages. I've also
                    used EventBot as an opportunity to hone my skills
                    at zero-friction testing and deployment.

                <dd>
                    Directory site for the largest Internet Yellow
                    Pages company in the Netherlands, with over 6.9
                    million monthly unique visitors. With colleagues
                    at <a href="http://www.localmatters.com/">Local
                    Matters</a>, I implemented cross-browser UI for
                    everything from basic pages to interactive
                    Javascript maps. I also worked closely with the
                    operations team to debug and resolve production
                    issues. Recently, I've taken the lead in
                    implementing performance improvements, including
                    request optimization
                    and <a href="http://www.varnish-cache.org/">Varnish</a>
                    caching, to greatly reduce hardware requirements
                    and speed up the site for end users.
