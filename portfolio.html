        <h1>Eric Entzel's Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Here are some of the projects I've worked on:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.ubermac.net/raidplanner/">Thunderclese's raid planner</a>
                    <p>A web app to help plan World of Warcraft raid groups.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.myeventbot.com/">EventBot</a>
                    <p>A tool to create Google Calendar events via email.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://en.detelefoongids.nl/">De Telefoongids</a>
                    <p>
                        Directory site for the largest Internet Yellow
                        Pages company in the Netherlands, with over 6.9
                        million monthly unique visitors. With colleagues at
                        <a href="http://www.localmatters.com/">Local
                            Matters</a>, I implemented cross-browser UI for
                        everything from basic pages to interactive
                        Javascript maps. I also worked closely with the
                        operations team to debug &amp; resolve production
                        issues. Recently, I've taken the lead in
                        implementing performance improvements, including
                        request optimization and Varnish caching, to greatly
                        reduce hardware requirements and speed up the site
                        for end users.
